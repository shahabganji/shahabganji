# Profile

Being in the industry for more than a decade, I have learnt that the only thing that matters in your team is collaboration and mutual respect. I have been working with Microsoft Technologies since 2003, ranging from .Net Framework 1.1 to .Net Core 2.2, and have always been passionate about web and databases, so I have done quite an effort to learn and use them to build robust, and reliable software. Being innovative, having a never-give-up attitude, learning cutting-edge technologies and employing them, to be an individual problem solver as well as a team player, are characteristics I am proud of.
